### 👋 Hi, I'm @HannahAdegoye

- 👀 I'm passionate about **DevOps, cloud computing, and automating software delivery pipelines**. I love designing scalable, secure, and reliable systems using **AWS, Terraform, Ansible, Docker, and Kubernetes**.
- 🤓If it’s a modern digital service or app that updates frequently, scales for millions, or needs high availability and security, DevOps is making it happen behind the scenes. Essentially, almost every app you use daily relies on DevOps in some way
- 🌱 I'm currently exploring **advanced CI/CD techniques, DevSecOps practices, and serverless architectures**. I’m also expanding my skills in **infrastructure automation, monitoring, and cloud-native optimisations**.

- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on **cloud, DevOps, and infrastructure projects**, particularly those that improve reliability, security, and performance. I enjoy contributing to open-source tools and building solutions that solve real-world problems.
