### 👋 Hi, I'm @HannahAdegoye

-I work across functional, system, and UAT testing to make sure applications behave as expected, data stays accurate, and users can trust the software they rely on.

I enjoy breaking down requirements into clear test scenarios, exploring edge cases, and finding defects before they reach production. My work covers test design, manual execution, defect tracking, and regression testing across complex applications and integrations.

I’m particularly interested in quality within fast-moving delivery environments — where frequent releases, automation, and continuous integration make testing even more critical. I’m developing my skills in test automation, API testing, and CI-based quality gates.

I’m open to collaborating on testing frameworks, quality tooling, and projects where reliability, usability, and stability matter. I enjoy contributing to repositories that improve how software is validated, released, and maintained
